" The most ambitious idea in the world of artificial intelligence is creating an entity comparable to a human in cognitive abilities, the so called AGI . We could debate how it may come about, whether it will settle the metaphysical question of whet makes humans who they are or open new doors in the discussion . But for a second let’s think like software architects and ask the question we should always tackle first before designing anything ."
 Machine learning (ML) is a field of computer science where algorithms improve their performance at a certain task as more data are observed .
